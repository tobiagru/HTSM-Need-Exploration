# Need Seeker App

This is the web app as part of the Needseeker app developed as part of the High Tech Startup Management Boot Camp. The App is a flask app that can be run via the typical flask commands (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). 

The main functionality of the app is a tinder based approach to collect customer needs for a set of questions.

Our Hypothesis was that a gamified approach to rating features of products, similar to how the swipe on tinder works could be a viable market research platform. We implemented a prototype of a Facebook app with a user facing swipe interface and automated analytics for clients for a set of car features based on input from a sales person from a large German car manufacturer. Ran the prototype for a week based on a fixed marketing budget and reported the results back succesful feedback. Later pitched the product idea to a set of investors.

The major models are questions with their possible answers and the actual answers by the users.
